# formal_field_encryption (Resource)

Creating Field Encryptions in Formal.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `alg` (String) Encryption Algorithm to use. Supported values are `aes_random` and `aes_deterministic`. For highest security, `aes_random` is recommended, but `aes_deterministic` is required to enable search (WHERE clauses) over underlying data in encrypted fields.
- `datastore_id` (String) Formal ID of the datastore that this Field Encryption should be applied to.
- `key_id` (String) Formal ID of the encryption key to be used for this field encryption. This encryption key will be used to encrypt the data key. Read about envelope encryption here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping
- `key_storage` (String) How the encrypted data key that encrypts the data should be stored. Use `control_plane_and_with_data` if the encrypted data key should be stored in the database alongside the encrypted data. Use `control_plane_only` if the encrypted data key should only be stored in the Formal Control Plane. In both cases, the data key is encrypted by the encryption key.
- `path` (String) The full path of the field that should be encrypted, separated by `.` (eg `{databaseName}.{schemaName}.{tableName}.{columnName}`)

### Optional

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
